### Hi there, I am Stephan, a software developer 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Python, more C++ and some more languages. 

I wrote my first program on a [TI-59 calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-59_/_TI-58)
that my mother had borrowed for a few days from her office in the early 1980s.
