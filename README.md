### Hi there, I am Stephan, a software developer 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Python, more C++ and more languages.

I wrote my first program on a [TI-59 calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-59_/_TI-58)
that my mother had borrowed for a few days from her office in the early 1980s.

Later we had some 8-bit computers in School. They were based on the U880, an East-German Z80 clone.

In the mid-80s, an ![Atari 800XL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Atari-800XL.jpg/280px-Atari-800XL.jpg) came to our home.
